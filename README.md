# Gnostica

A Clojure and ClojureScript tarot app using re-frame and shadow-cljs.

## Development

Install Java, the Clojure CLI, and Node.js, then run:

```sh
clojure -M:dev
```

The shadow-cljs dev server serves the app at `http://localhost:8080`. Node.js is still required by shadow-cljs for browser builds, but the default workflow does not use npm.

## Commands

```sh
clojure -M:dev       # start the ClojureScript watcher
clojure -M:release   # compile an optimized browser build
clojure -M:server    # serve the released app with Clojure/Ring
clojure -M:test      # run Clojure tests for shared code
```

## Version Control

This project is initialized for Jujutsu:

```sh
jj status
jj diff
jj describe -m "Describe the current change"
jj commit -m "Commit message"
```
